#PPrint Module
The PPrint module provides a useful interface for printing abstract syntax trees (ASTs) generated by the Spr LOL Ctz IC Compiler. It provides methods for printing all nodes and children. It also allows printing of the whole AST from the program node. 

#Command Line Arguments
To enable priting of the AST, run:
```bash
$./icc test/parserTest/pass/test3.ic pprint
```
 
To enable printing of cheerful felines, run:
```bash
$./icc test/parserTest/pass/test3.ic cats
```

Both arguments are supported simultaneously and independently, and order does influence output.

#Automated Running AST PPrinting
To run all parser test cases with AST PPrinting enabled, run:
```bash
runASTPPrint.bash v .
```
This runs all the pass and fail test cases. Note, that when the parser fails, no AST will be generated. Therefore, there is not a PPrint AST printed. 

If you desire cheerful felines here, use the c command line option: 
```bash
runASTPPrint.bash . c
```

Note that here, the order of c and v is important. Also, if you are not using one of the options, a period or other character must be supplied. 


#Design Methodology
The pprint module is implemented with successive method calls to all children of a given node. These calls in turn perform calls for their children. In this way, all nodes in the tree are printed and hierarchy is represented.
