#Make the Project
To run the most recent code, you'll need to make the project. To do this, first go to this directory with: 
```bash
cd ~/ic-compiler/icc
```
Next, make the project:
```bash
make
```
This will compile all the source code so you run the most recent version. 

#Running The Parser Test Framework
To tun test framework, you must be in this directory. If you're not already there, get there with: 
```bash
cd ~/ic-compiler/icc
```

or an alternative path depending on where and how you cloned the repository. Next, run: 
```bash
bash runTests.bash . .
```

##Minimal Output
For a minimal output, run runTests.bash with any argument which is not v. Minimal output only prints the success/failure of each test case and summary statistics about the testing process. 
```bash
bash runTests.bash . .
```

##Verbose Output
For a verbose output, which prints all tokens generated by the lexer for each test case, run: 
```bash
bash runTests.bash v .
```

This will run all test cases in the pass and fail folders of the test directory. It will also produce a summary output. 

##LOL CTZ option
If you desire a cheerful LOL Cat in your terminal, run runTests.bash with the c (cat) argument: 
```bash
bash runTests.bash . c
```
We highly recommend the LOL cat option as cats greatly increase programmer happiness. 

##Example Output
An example output using the minimal and LOL cat option is presented.

#Testing Methodology
The runParserTests.bash script runs any test in the pass or fail directory which has a *.ic file extension. Any test case whose output does not match its directory is noted and will result in the test script reporting failure of the test run. 

Each file is run with:
```bash
scala -cp bin ic.Compiler <testCaseFileName.ic> 
```

As the test cases are run, the results of each test case is reported to the user. Aditionally, summary statistics (the total number of tests and pass/fail tests for each test) are recorded, and reported to the user. 

#Adding New Test Cases
Adding new test cases is simple. Simply add a new *.ic file into the appropriate directory (test/parserTest/pass or test/parserTest/fail). By convention, test names are sequentially numbered; however, the script is ambivalent about test number in the file name.
